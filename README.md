# **Cognito Canvas** ‚ú®üß†

## DESCRIPTION

Alright, geniuses, listen up. Cognito Canvas is your personal digital whiteboard that's actually smart. Scribble, draw, jot down equations ‚Äì this Kivy app takes your chaotic brilliance and turns it into clean code, math solutions, and summarized notes. Think J.A.R.V.I.S., but for your doodles. Runs on Android, because who carries a laptop anymore?

## FEATURES

*   **Interactive Kivy Canvas:** Go wild. Draw shapes, write text, sketch flowcharts. It's your playground. ‚úçÔ∏è
*   **Handwritten Math Solver:** Scrawled an equation? Our OCR reads it (yeah, even *your* handwriting) and SymPy solves it. Basic algebra/arithmetic, don't get crazy. üßÆ
*   **Flowchart-to-Code Stubs:** Draws basic flowcharts (shapes, arrows)? OpenCV spots 'em and spits out Python function/conditional stubs. It's like magic, but it's just code. ü™Ñ
*   **AI Note Taker:** Reads your text (OCR again) and eyeballs your drawings to give you the TL;DR. Big brain summaries, low effort. üòé
*   **Multi-modal Input Processing:** It looks at your drawings *and* reads your text to actually get the vibe. Context is everything, peeps.

## LEARNING BENEFITS

Level up your game. You'll build a multi-modal AI, smash Computer Vision (OpenCV) with OCR (EasyOCR) and math vibes (SymPy). Get hands-on with Kivy for mobile apps and UI/UX that doesn't suck. Basically, build your own mini-J.A.R.V.I.S. and prove you've got a heart... for killer productivity. üöÄ

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

The Stark Tech behind the magic:

*   **kivy:** The suit ‚Äì framework and UI for the Android app.
*   **opencv-python:** The eyes ‚Äì image processing, shape spotting, prepping for OCR.
*   **easyocr:** The translator ‚Äì reads handwriting and text like a champ.
*   **sympy:** The brainiac ‚Äì parses and solves those math problems.
*   **networkx (Optional):** For when your flowcharts get spicy and need real analysis.
*   **nltk or spacy (Optional):** If you wanna get fancy with text summaries.

## SETUP AND INSTALLATION

Less talking, more doing. Get this running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omdeepb69/cognito-canvas.git
cd cognito-canvas
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Boom. Done. You're welcome.

## USAGE

Just run the main script, `main.py`. Easy peasy. Tweak `config.json` if you feel like messing with the settings (at your own risk, obviously).

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

It's organized, unlike your desk probably.

*   `src/`: Where the core magic happens (source code).
*   `tests/`: Making sure things don't blow up (unit tests).
*   `docs/`: Manuals are for rookies, but here's some info anyway (documentation).
